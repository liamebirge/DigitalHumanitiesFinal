				<h2><u>What Is This Site?</u></h2>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up wondering 'what is the oldest thing in the world?' after learning every atom on this planet has been around since the beginning of time, I adjusted my question to be 'what is the oldest object created by humman-kind?' This and the suggestions from my family, lead me to discover antiques. When you look at something older than 100 years, you are looking at a sliver of history. The places this item have traveled and the people who have had it in their posession by that point may be quite numerable. Each owner and each place an antique travels leaves a mark (however small), adding to the item's history.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website is a gallery containing all of the antiques I have collected over my life, including detailed descriptions, and various other forms of metadata for each item. My goal is to as accurately as possible, document and record each item to preserve it (in the best known way possible, so far) on the internet.

				<h2><u>Tips For Using The Website</u></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Hovering over the images in the antique item pages will flip them to a scan of the reverse side of the item</li>
					<li>Books however, do not flip on hover, once the book pdf has loaded scroll down to view more pages</li>
					<li>Use the arrows at the top right of the antique item pages to navigate through the list of antiques</li>
